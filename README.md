# CHP Incident Archiver

The California Highway Patrol (CHP) Traffic Incident Information Page provides a live, recent feed of CHP in-progress incidents. The page however does not archive past incidents and the California Data Portal does not offer an archive either.

This archiver project intends to parse a (deprecated) CalTrans QuickMap KML and store it in a relational database such as PostGIS.
